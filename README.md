# -PyBer_Analysis
#Overview of the Analysis
For deliverable 1 The purpose of this analysis is to provide a summary DataFrame by the group by method. By classifying the methods for total drivers by city type. Also, by using the average far per ride for each city type. Then creating a new DataFrame and then cleaning it up. For Deliverable two it is to read the merged dataframe. Creating a resample DataFrame and then using matplotlib to create a pivot chart.
#Results
The results show the data is defined in the Urban category. Where the most rides are taken more in the city results.
#Summary
Three recommendations based on the results.
1.	To do more rides in the urban area and not the rural areas as it is not making much money.
2.	Peak performance time is in March, so have more drivers available.
3.	January is a slower month. So have less drivers.
